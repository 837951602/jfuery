As I see https://github.com/fasttime/jquery-screwed, I decided to make a shorter one.
I thought it should be easy to reach 14*filesize(Resultly 1,022,478/86,644=11.800909468630257144176169151932) 
but failed for some times: <down are my ways>
I thought of (function(x){push(x);return argument.callee})(arg1)(arg2)(arg3)...(argn)
but when I ran it on Maxthon it says "Stack size exceeded".
So I had to let [][[]] be the function so I can directly call the function with least chars(I don't need argn=undefined)
And use '+' to connect two function call to replace ','.

Source can be found by:
 1. find the first occurance of ()+[][[]]
 2. copy chars before the occurance(excluding the occurance itself)
 3. paste and remove the first [
 4. evaluate it
